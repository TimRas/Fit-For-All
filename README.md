For the use of allauth, i've copied the use for the authentication backends and some of the required apps from the allauth documentation (https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

I sticked to the same bootstrap starter template version as the boutique ado project. I don't  want to stray away too far from the boutique ado project. This so I can use the example of this project for my own project. It gives me guidance for my own project. (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template)
