### Design

For the designing of the the Fit For All application, we mainly focused on keeping it simple by using minimal colours so that the focus lays mainly on the interactive parts. The typography keeps the application look simple and easily accesible. The images and favicon icons have been provided to me by a dear friend of ours who will be referred to in the credits. The favicon icon uses the same colour pallette as the rest of the application to make it fit with the application itself. The idea was to not overload the user with too much stimuli thus keeping it inviting for any user. 

#### Color Palette

<div style="background-color: #db4c4c; width: 100px; height: 30px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 10px;"></div>
<div style="background-color: #f2f1f1; width: 100px; height: 30px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 10px;"></div>
<div style="background-color: #f2f1f1; width: 100px; height: 30px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 10px;"></div>

#### Wireframes

In the early stages of developing the Fit For All application, we've created wireframes to start laying the founding of what we feel needs to be implied in this project and to serve as a blueprint for the design and development process. Please note that these are preliminary designs and some features may be different than in the final project. Balsamiq wireframes was used.

<strong>Home/Index Page</strong>

![Home wireframe](media/main_page.png)

- The content of the home page has changed quite a lot from the initial wireframe. Instead of showing and motivation quotes or comments. We've decided instead that it would be better for the user experience to introduce all main section of the application.


<strong>Plans Main</strong>

- Later on in the development of the project, we've decided that for better user experience, we would create a main page to show each plans category instead of directly showing all plans with all categories combined. Thus there is no wireframe of this page.


<strong>Plans Category</strong>

![Plans category wireframe](media/plans_category.png)

- The plans category page has stayed mostly the same for the exception of the plans content which reverses its tags for each plan/challenge.The icon on the left was ment to display the intensity of the plan/challeng itself but has not been implemented.


<strong>Plans Details</strong>

![Plans details wireframe](media/plans_details.png)

- The plans/challenge details page content has mostly been applied but the review and checkbox functionality has not been applied. This is still considered a feature to be of value for future inplementation.

<strong>Products</strong>

![Products wireframe](media/products.png)

- Products page features has been applied. Due to the sorting feature in the header, the category has not been added to the products itself.

<strong>Product Details</strong>

![Products details wireframe](media/product_details.png)

- The products details functionality has mostly been applied instead of the reviews. Will be applied in the future for increased value and user experience.

<strong>Blogs Main</strong>

- As the plans main page, the blogs main page has been added later on in the development of the project. We've decided that for better user experience, we would create a main page to show each blogs category instead of directly showing all blogs with all categories combined as the plans main page. Thus there is no wireframe of this page.

<strong>Blogs Category</strong>

![Blogs category wireframe](media/blogs_category.png)

- The blogs category page has stayed mostly the same for the exception of the blogs content which reverses its tags for each blog. The like/dislike functionality has not been applied but will be applied in the future.

<strong>Blogs Details</strong>

![Blogs details wireframe](media/blog_details.png)

- The content of the blogs details page has stayed mostly the same as the wireframe but the like/dislike functionality has not been applied as of yet. The create post div is ment to be the div to add a comment. This has been applied.

<strong>Shopping Bag</strong>

![Shopping bag wireframe](media/shopping_bag.png)

- The shopping bag has been applied as the same maanner as the wireframe.

<strong>Checkout Page</strong>

![Checkout page wireframe](media/checkout.png)

- The checkout page has been applied as intended as shown on the wireframe.

<strong>Checkout Success Page</strong>

![Checkout success wireframe](media/checkout_success.png)

- The checkout success page has been applied as intended as shown on the wireframe but the optional gif has not been applied as we considered that this would not add a lot of value to the user experience.

<strong>Profile</strong>

![Profile wireframe](media/profile.png)

- A lot of useful features for the user has not been applied as of yet to the profile page. But the most essential features such as the order history and billing information have been added.

<strong>Sign-in/Log-out</strong>

![Sign-in/Log-out wireframe](media/log_in_sign_up_basis.png)

- The wireframe has been followed as intended but the app quote didn't seem essential at the time but can be applied in the future.

<strong>Sign-up</strong>

![Sign-in/Log-out wireframe](media/sign_up.png)

- The wireframe has been followed as intended but the app quote didn't seem essential at the time but can be applied in the future and no subscription feature has been applied for this app as it was decided that this was not the payment model.

<strong>Admin CRUD</strong>

![Admin CRUD wireframe](media/main_crud_basis.png)

- The wireframe has been taking for the basis of all main admin CRUD functionality. Each admin crud features has been changed for its intended purpose.

### Content

I would like to thanks of own of my closest friends [Thomas Huijbens](https://www.thomashuijbens.net/) for helping me get the artwork I wanted for this project. Thomas Huijbens is a graphic designer based in the Netherlands who was able to provide me with some amazing (and quite experimental) artwork. Without him this project would have not been the way I wanted it to be. Finally I also want to thank all my friends and family for encouraging me to continue working on this course during challenging times. Without them I wouldn't have had the strength to finish the final milestone project. I hope with all my heart that I am able to complete this course with a diploma so they can be proud of me and especially me of myself. It has been a long journey but I feel that I have learned an amazing and intriguing skillset that I am able to build a bright career out of. Thank you to code institute for also giving me the time and space to finish all the projects and being understanding of my situation.

### Acknowledgements

I've used source code of the boutique ado project and adjusted it where necessary for my own project.

The main source code I used from boutique ado is:

#### Products

-views, models, forms

#### Checkout

-views, signals, models, forms

#### Bag

-views, contexts, bag_tools, quantity_input_script

### Notes

- Due to this project being drawn out over a long time, I haven't been consistent in the use of my user stories. I want to add that I understand how they should be used and that in upcoming projects I will be more pragmatic in the use of them.

- I haven't added any "nofollow" or "sponsored" rel attributes to any links because none of my links come from any paid links or any distrusted content as all links refer to my own contant or facebook/mailchimp which is a trusted source. Also, none of my links are sponsored or compensated.

- Due to a lack of time I haven't been able to run all my code through all validators(html,css,js) but I have tried to reduce as many python errors using flake8. Will run all code through all validators in the future.
