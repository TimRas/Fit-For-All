    <ul>
        <li> functional posts and comments</li>
        <li> CRUD functionality</li>
        <li> individual products details</li>
        <li> individual workout plans details</li>
        <li> e-commerce funtionality to through subscription</li>
        <li> e-commerce functionality to products</li>
        <li> order information</li>
        <li> order confirmation</li>
        <li> messages</li>
        <li> testing</li>
        <li> 404 Page</li>
        <li> personalize user profile</li>
        <li> sorting of products</li>
